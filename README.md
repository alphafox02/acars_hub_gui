# FlightView GUI

Welcome to the FlightView GUI repository. This project provides a user-friendly graphical interface to manage and configure Docker-based aircraft-related services, including `tar1090`, `readsb`, and `acarshub`. With this GUI, you can easily adjust basic settings, start and stop services, and enjoy real-time monitoring of ADSB and ACARS data.

## Getting Started

To use this project, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- A Linux system (tested on WarDragon)
- Docker Compose
- Docker installed
- Git (for cloning the repository)
- One or more RTL-SDR devices (for `readsb`, `acarshub`, and `dump978`)

### Set up Docker's apt repository

First, set up Docker's apt repository. These steps are already completed on the WarDragon. Open a terminal and run the following commands:

```bash
# Add Docker's official GPG key:
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ca-certificates curl gnupg
sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg
sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg

# Add the repository to Apt sources:
echo \
  "deb [arch="$(dpkg --print-architecture)" signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
  "$(. /etc/os-release && echo "$VERSION_CODENAME")" stable" | \
  sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
sudo apt-get update

# Install the Docker packages.
# To install the latest version, run:
sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin
```

### Clone the Repository

You can clone this repository to any directory you prefer on your local system. If you are on WarDragon, you can also find it in `/usr/src`.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alphafox02/flightview_gui.git
```

#### Update the Repository (Optional)

If you have already cloned the repository and want to update it, navigate to the project directory and run the following command:

```bash
git pull
```

### Using the GUI

The FlightView GUI offers an intuitive interface to configure and manage Aircraft services. It includes three tabs for the following services (for now):

- **tar1090 Configuration:**
  - Configure `docker-compose-tar1090.yml` settings such as latitude, longitude, and timezone.
  - Start and stop the `tar1090` service.
  - Real-time service status display.

- **readsb Configuration:**
  - Configure `docker-compose-readsb.yml` settings, including basic options.
  - Manually configure advanced settings such as RTL-SDR device configuration in the YAML file.
  - Start and stop the `readsb` service.
  - Real-time service status display.

- **acarshub Configuration:**
  - Configure `docker-compose-acars-vhf.yml` settings, including basic options.
  - Manually configure advanced settings such as RTL-SDR device configuration in the YAML file.
  - Start and stop the `acarshub` service.
  - Real-time service status display.

Use these tabs to set basic parameters like latitude (LAT), longitude (LONG), timezone (TZ), and feed ID (FEED_ID). For advanced settings and additional configurations, you'll need to manually edit the corresponding Docker Compose YAML files. The GUI simplifies basic configurations but may not cover all advanced options.

### Access the Web Interfaces

After configuring the services, you can access their web interfaces as follows:

- **ACARS Hub:** [http://localhost](http://localhost)
- **READSB:** [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
- **tar1090:** [http://localhost:8078](http://localhost:8078)

Make sure that you have the required RTL-SDR devices connected and properly recognized by your system for services that use them.
